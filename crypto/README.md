# Cryptographic Challenges

These challenges usually involve cracking or decrypting some encryption to reveal a flag. 
 Our goal for FrecklesCon CTF is to use these to teach topics related to:
- Ciphers
- Hashes
- Steganography

## Challenge 1: Baby's First Encryption
This ecryption is ROTten

## Challenge 2: 
Freckles is learning the difference between encryption and encoding
