# Reverse Engineering

These challenges usually provide Linux ELF executables or Windows EXEs and require some reverse engineering to pull some info out in a more human readable format.

Our goal for FrecklesCon CTF is to use these to teach topics related to:
- Tool basics (ghidra, radare2, etc)
- Executable file structures

## Challenge 1: What's Cracking?
Freckles, being a cyber savvy dog, put his flag in a 32 bit binary written he wrote in assembly! To be extra safe he used a whopping 16 character alphanumeric password! That's over 7,958,661,109,946,400,884,391,936 possible different passwords! The only problem though, is that he forgot the password to his flag! Maybe you can crack his password!

### Flag: frecklesCon22{fr3ckl35c0nrul35}

## Challenge 2: We'll Do It Live!
Freckles, being the little jerk he is, decided to hide the flag in the binary again, but this time getting the passcode right may not be enough...

## Challenge 3: House of Pain
Freckles realizes he needs to protect his tech from 1337 H4XORZ like you, so he put his flag in the binary this time, but figuring out the passcode may not be enough (again) and this time he learned to make his data unreachable...or so he thinks.

### Challenge 4: Memory Game
Freckles thinks this challenge would be a lot easier if he knew how to read...
