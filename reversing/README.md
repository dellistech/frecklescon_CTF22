# Reverse Engineering

These challenges usually provide Linux ELF executables or Windows EXEs and require some reverse engineering to pull some info out in a more human readable format.

Our goal for FrecklesCon CTF is to use these to teach topics related to:
- Tool basics (ghidra, radare2, etc)
- Executable file structures

## Challenge 1: What's Cracking?
Freckles, being a cyber savvy dog, put his flag in a 32 bit binary written he wrote in assembly! To be extra safe he used a whopping 16 character alphanumeric password! That's over 7,958,661,109,946,400,884,391,936 possible different passwords! The only problem though, is that he forgot the password to his flag! Maybe you can crack his password!

### Password: fr3ckl35c0nrul35
### Flag: frecklesCon22{cr4ck_m3_1f_y0u_c4n}
