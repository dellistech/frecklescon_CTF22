# File Shenanigans

## Challenge 1: This is why we have trust issues
Freckles knows he has in this file, but when he tries to open the PDF, it won't open. Maybe he shouldn't be so trusting about what files claim to be. 

## Challenge 2: Different kind of image
Freckles stored his flag as an image, but he might have misunderstood what he meant by image...

## Challenge 3: What kind of file is it?
Freckles again can't open his PDF, can you help him?

## Challenge 4: I think there's something in here
Freckles is a 1337 haxor, he hides his flags in his selfies.

## Challenge 5: pRoBlEmS wItH cApItAlS
Freckles hid his flag but he thinks something went wrong with the file, a typo maybe?

## Challege 6: Freckle's Selfie
Freckles took this adorable selfie, but the file seems bigger than it should be.....
